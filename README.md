# random-walker

## Finally! I'm back.
Well, after +1 year, I'm finally back to Processing/p5.js. And, to start this journey again, I've made this code.
You can take a look by clicking on the link on the right panel or [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1615294).

## How to use it
Obs.: By defautl, the code starts with one walker on the screen.
You can use some keys to play araound this:
```
1. r : restart all the walkers at a random position;
2. e : delete ALL the walkers (blank screen);
3. d : delete all the walkers, except for the first one created;
4. Arrow UP : create more walkers (one per key press);
5: Arrow DOWN : delete the last created walker;
6. s : special. Restart all the walkers at coodinate (widht, height) of the screen (lower right diagonal).
```
**When a walker is deleted, the path it has been AREN'T deleted

## Final result

(using the ```s``` key).
